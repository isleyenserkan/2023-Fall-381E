    "Overall rules:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Refrain from downloading and loading data from a local file. Instead, obtain all required data using the appropriate API.\n",
    "- Do not download data in separate parts. For instance, in Q1 where data for 22 countries is necessary, obtain the data in a single, large piece and partition it later on.\n",
    "- Avoid duplicating code by copying and pasting it from one cell to another. If copying and pasting is necessary, develop a suitable function for the task at hand and call that function.\n",
    "- When providing parameters to a function, never utilize global variables. Instead, always pass parameters explicitly and always make use of local variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Failure to adhere to these guidelines will result in a 25-point deduction for each infraction."
